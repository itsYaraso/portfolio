        I am 31, father of 3 based in Finland, originating from Manchester, United Kingdom.

        I like figuring out and solving puzzles no matter how difficult it may be it, it is
        always excilirating when you have solved something you have never tried before.

        Being a self taught developer has had it's challenges
        but this allows me to come at and tackle problems from a different perspective allowing me to try new approaches and options
